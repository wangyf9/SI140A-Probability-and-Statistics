## Course Project

This is a basic reinforce learning project with reward and action, but without state. In this project, if you can finish it, you will have a basic understanding of reinforce learning. For example, you can know how to make a decision between exploration and exploitation, and study multi policies during this problem. For further study, you can visit this [website](https://hrl.boyuai.com/chapter/1/%E5%A4%9A%E8%87%82%E8%80%81%E8%99%8E%E6%9C%BA) for advanced reinforce learning.
